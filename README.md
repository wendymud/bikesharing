As depicted in the Tableau story, the data first point shows a high concentraion of starting points on the map.  The darker images shows the highest numbers as those are more popular tourist destinations.

It was also determined that the average trip duration was higher with older clientele as the data was compared to the age of users.  In addition, the checkout times happened more frequently with men than women or non-gender clients.

When observing the trips by weekday, there were some clear indicators of peak usage.  Mostly during the rush hour times of 7-9am and 5-7pm.  Another interesting observation was that the count of rides was definitely higher Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.  

## Summary

In conclusion, Citibike can utilize this information in many different ways.  One example is to populate the higher traffic areas with more male-sized bikes, as that seems to be the more popular gender clientele.  Another example, during peak times, possibly allow a peak-usage fee, to gain a higher profit margin.  Or another way of utilizing this data might be to market to more of the female clientele, by adding smaller framed bikes to suit and to help gain popularity with female riders.  Citibike has many options in terms of utilizing this data and I think they will be able to uncover even more data in the coming months with these new changes.
